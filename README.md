# HeartDiseaseAnalysis
Utilized a Kaggle dataset in order to create a Neural Network that took in multiple factors like age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, etc. Used these factors to determine whether a patient will have heart disease or not, however the dataset used only has about 300 different test cases 80% of which are used to train the model and 20% of which are used to test it.
